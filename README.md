# c64games
A collection of my C64 games

This repository contains executable versions of all my C64 games that I've released on Github so far. Alle these games were written in BASIC and compiled using MOSpeed.


These are:

* Brotquest: A text adventure about getting a C64 (german)

* Brotquest 2: Another text adventure, this time about getting an Amiga (german)

* Vittorio: An artillery duel like game

* Mostris: A variant of another famous game that ends with ...tris

* Uberswap: A match three game

* Moscription: A deck building card game

* Kidelyneen: A qix inspired game
